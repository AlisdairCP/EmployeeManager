# Employee Manager Project
A basic employee manager for an ambiguous workplace which demonstrates C++ knowledge. 
## Versions
### v0.1.0
Initial version of the manager. Allows a user to sign in as an administrator to add, view, remove or update employee record .csv files. Alternatively, they can merely view the records as an employee. 
## Future release plans
* Only accept records under a given format.
* Prevent duplicate record IDs.
* Allow users to change their password.
## Instructions
### Setting up
Download the repo using the "Download ZIP" option and launch the "Employee-Manager.exe" file. Alternatively, you can download the .exe file in the "Releases" section.
### Using the manager
* Enter the password. As of this build, the only available password is "password".
* Pick a number from 1-3. 1 lets you log in as an admin, 2 lets you log in as an employee, 3 exits the app.
* As an admin, pick a number from 1-6. 1 returns you to the main menu, 2 lets you view the employee list, 3 lets you add an employee record , 4 lets you delete an employee record, 5 lets you update an employee record, and 6 exits the manager.
* As an employee, input a .csv file, like the one provided in the repository, and view the contents.
